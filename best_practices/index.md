### Best Practice #1 â€“ Use of Objectives

(Since Objectives usage outside of course structure is not defined.)

Objectives are defined for the course structure, but there is no language in the specification concerning their usage in statements. If using Objectives in statements (as Activities) the best practice is to use the Activity Definition type (http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/objective) from the ADL vocabulary.

The same Objective can be referenced by multiple AU or Blocks. There are 2 ways to interpret meeting an Objective. The two expected practices are:

1. All elements referencing the Objective need to be Satisfied (or met moveOn criteria)
1. Only one element referencing the Objective needs to be Satisfied (or met moveOn criteria).

It is recommended that LMS developers document how they do this and allow for an extension (in the course structure) to indicate what method should be used.
